# Jahcord
Java Swing Discord client.

## Notes
- This is probably against the Discord TOS. I cannot recommend that you actually use this without risk.
- The library also seems to fail for user accounts (or takes an incredibly long time to load) when in a large number of group chats??

## Missing features
- Channel message history (seeing previous messages).
- Settings screen.
- Private messaging.
- File sending.
- Emote selection.
- Unicode display.

## Dependencies
- [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
- [FlatLAF](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf)
- Themes from [here](https://github.com/mallowigi/material-theme-ui-lite)
