# Jahcord
Java Swing Discord client.
Read about this [here](https://kvnx.systems/posts/jahcord)

## Notes
- This is probably against the Discord TOS. I cannot recommend that you actually use this without risk.
- The library also seems to fail for user accounts (or takes an incredibly long time to load) when in a large number of group chats??

## Missing features
- Settings screen.
- Responding to private messaging.
- File sending.
- Emote selection.
- Unicode display.
- Replace images with links
