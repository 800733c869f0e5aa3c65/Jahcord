# Jahcord
Java Swing Discord client.

## Notes
- This is probably against the Discord TOS. I cannot recommend that you actually use this without risk.
- This also seems to fail when in a large number of group chats?? (Works fine on an account in only 1 but not one with many.)

## Dependencies
- [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
- [FlatLAF](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf)
- Themes from [here](https://github.com/mallowigi/material-theme-ui-lite)
